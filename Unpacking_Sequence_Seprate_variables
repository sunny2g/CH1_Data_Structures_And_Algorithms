# PROBLEM-You have an N-element tuple or sequence that you would like to unpack into a collection
# of N variables. pg 19

# In this example we first assigned p a list and then assigned values to values to variable from list 
p = (4,5);
print(p);
x,y=p;
x;
y;

# Another example

data=['TATA',50,91.1,(2012,12,22)];
name,shares,price,data=data;
# OR >>>name,shares,price,(year,month,day)=data; can be used
name;
date;

# Unpacking of strings and it can work with any iterable object for ex., tuple,lists,strings,files etc.

s='hello';
a,b,c,d,e=s;
a;
e;

# How to dicard values while unpacking 

data=['TATA',50,91.1,(2012,12,22)];
_,shares,price,_=data;
shares;
price;
_;
